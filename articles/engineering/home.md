## 1. High-Integrity Slave Movements:

The core of reliable timekeeping, our slave movements are engineered for longevity and precision. We meticulously manufacture each component using high-quality materials:

Enclosures (304 Grade Stainless Steel): Our slave movement enclosures are constructed from durable 304-grade stainless steel, providing exceptional resistance to corrosion and environmental factors, ensuring long-term protection for the internal mechanisms.

Pinions (Gun Metal & 304 Grade Stainless Steel): We utilize the optimal materials for our pinions, employing both the wear-resistant properties of Gun Metal and the robust strength of 304-grade stainless steel. This ensures efficient power transfer and minimal wear over time.

Gears (Gun Metal & 304 Grade Stainless Steel): Similar to our pinions, our gears are manufactured using a combination of Gun Metal for its excellent bearing properties and 304-grade stainless steel for its strength and resistance to deformation. This material selection guarantees precise meshing and reliable operation.

Base Plates (Gun Metal & 304 Grade Stainless Steel): The foundation of our slave movements is built with precision-machined base plates made from both Gun Metal and 304-grade stainless steel. This ensures the stable and accurate alignment of all movement components.
